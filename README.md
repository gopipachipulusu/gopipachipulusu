## 💪 Core Strengths & Impact


**Ultra-Low Latency:** Engineered real-time data streaming architectures, reducing data latency from minutes to sub-10 seconds.

**Performance Optimization:** Consistently optimized distributed PySpark and SQL workloads, achieving up to a 40-60% reduction in ETL runtime and query load times across Databricks and Snowflake.

**Data Governance & Quality:** Implemented robust governance (e.g., Unity Catalog and IAM) and data quality frameworks that improved data integrity by 90% and minimized security incidents.

**Automation & Migration:** Automated CI/CD pipelines, cutting deployment time from hours to minutes, and designed migration frameworks that reduced manual effort by 80% 

## 📈 Next Generation Skills
Currently focusing on mastering advanced MLOps and Generative AI patterns on Azure and Aws to bridge the gap between Data Engineering and Machine Learning:

AI/ML & Generative AI
MLOps Integration: Deepening knowledge of MLOps best practices, including model tracking (MLflow) and deployment (e.g., AWS SageMaker Pipelines), to seamlessly transition models from training to production.

RAG Architecture: Actively exploring and implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns using LLMs (e.g., LangChain) to connect external, proprietary data to foundation models for more accurate, context-aware AI applications.

Prompt Engineering: Focusing on advanced prompt engineering and model fine-tuning techniques to ensure data quality and relevance for superior AI performance.

Advanced Cloud Platforms (Azure & AWS)
Modern Azure Ecosystem: Gaining hands-on experience with Microsoft Fabric and exploring deeper integration of Azure Purview for unified data governance across the enterprise data estate.

Data Mesh & Open Standards: Learning open data formats like Apache Iceberg for building flexible, multi-cloud data architectures and improving query performance for cross-platform analytics.

Advanced Orchestration: Mastering advanced data scheduling and dependency management using Apache Airflow for complex, highly distributed data pipelines across heterogeneous cloud environments.
